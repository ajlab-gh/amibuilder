# Custom Image Builder

This tool allows you to build custom AMI's in AWS using Terraform. Follow the steps below to get started.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://ajlab-gh/amibuilder
cd amibuilder
```

### 2. Initialize Terraform
Run the following command to initialize Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
```

### 3. Set AWS Environment Variables
Set your AWS credentials as environment variables. Replace `<YOUR_AWS_KEY>`, `<YOUR_AWS_SECRET>`, and `<YOUR_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN>` with your AWS details:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<YOUR_AWS_KEY>"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<YOUR_AWS_SECRET>"
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="<YOUR_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN>"
```

### 4. Create a Key Pair
If you do not have OpenSSH installed, please follow these steps for installation:

# Installing OpenSSH Client for Certificate Generation

## Ubuntu Installation
1. Update package list
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Install OpenSSH client only
   ```bash
   sudo apt install openssh-client
   ```

3. Verify installation
   ```bash
   ssh -V
   ```

## Windows Installation

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator

2. Check if OpenSSH Client is already installed
   ```powershell
   Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH.Client*'
   ```

3. Install OpenSSH Client if not installed
   ```powershell
   Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
   ```

4. Verify installation
   ```powershell
   ssh -V
   ```

After installation on either system, you can generate SSH keys using:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f aws_key_pair
```

This will generate two files:
- `aws_key_pair` (private key)
- `aws_key_pair.pub` (public key)

Keep the private key (`aws_key_pair`) secure as it will be required to SSH into the instance.

### 5. Add Your Custom Image
Place your custom image in the root directory of the project. **The image must be a `qcow2` format.**

### 6. Build Your Image
Deploy the configuration by applying Terraform:
```bash
terraform apply
```
Confirm the deployment when prompted.

## üìù Notes

- Verify that your AWS IAM user has sufficient permissions to create key pairs, EC2 instances, and related resources.
- Store the private key (`aws_key_pair`) securely; it will be required for SSH access to the EC2 instance.
- Use the following command to clean up resources provisioned by Terraform when they're no longer needed:
  ```bash
  terraform destroy
  ```
- **Important**: Manually delete assets created by the EC2 host. Resources such as `snapshots` and `AMIs` will persist after running `terraform destroy`, as they are not managed directly by Terraform.
